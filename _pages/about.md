My name is Crapenter Cheung (张旻昊 in Chinese). I'm a one year undergraduate student at [Center for Combinatorics](https://cfc.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). My research interest includes algebraic geometry(Hilbert Scheme in particial), MacDonald polynomial and dyck path algebra.

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haitao Cao](https://math.nu.edu.cn/info/1074/6248.htm) from [School of Math Science](https://math.njnu.edu.cn/), Nanjing normal University during my undergraduate period. I am now advised by [Dun Qiu](https://qiudun123.github.io/)
.
 You can contact me via the following ways:

Here is my CV(in Chinese): [张旻昊的个人简历](../assets/CV.pdf)

2024年5月，我为南京师范大学制作了一份beamer模板，业已上传至[overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/nnu-beamer-carpenter/gfppmtqybvpb)。这是从Verona中改编得到的。希望后来者使用。
